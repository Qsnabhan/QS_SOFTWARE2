# QS_SOFTWARE2

The high cost of purchasing and maintaining the QS software, forced the tight budget companies to perform QS work in traditional ways.
Therefore, the traditional quantity survey work, which is done manually, leads to many errors in calculations and takes time and effort 
to correct errors. In addition, the manual calculation often leads to delay of completing the quantity survey report in line with 
the project plan. The main objectives of this research work are, to overcome the higher price of acquiring and maintaining
the QS Software and to automate the calculation of the quantity survey process, including multi-phases of building construction, 
such as work on the Foundation, Footing & Floors stages, summarize and analyze the data and make it accessible on demand. 
It includes details about the concrete, steel, blocks, cement and sand quantity respectively.  In order to achieve 
the main objectives in this research; .Net framework (ASP.net and C#) technology has been used to develop the proposed system.
The research work conducts an assessment to compare the effectiveness of the proposed system with manual work and Excel.
The research work used real data, construction maps and manual work collected from private building company located in ‘Sohar City’. 
The collected data were assessed, analyzed and evaluated with   the proposed system. It resulted of higher rate of productivity after 
automating the data entry and the calculation process. High precision was acquired once clash and error detected by the proposed system.
The comparative study achieved higher accuracy; the proposed system could calculate the QS work that holds one hundred and thirty 
worksheets in a proportional relationship estimated in hour’s timepieces with relative values of 0.5: 21 using manual work 
and 0.5:3.5 using Excel. In addition, the achieved accuracy of the QS calculations can save thousands of Omani Rials 
when the error rate is one hundred baisa. The obtained outcomes from this work, are promising which makes the developed
‘WEB-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR STRUCTURE CONCRETE OF QUANTITIES SURVEY’ system, very practical and useful for fast quantity
surveys deliveries like quotations and quick evaluation of property. 
This work will help companies to be faster and stay ahead of competition with much more accuracy and extensive analysis.
